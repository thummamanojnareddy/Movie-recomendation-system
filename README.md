# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System using Streamlit

A web-based movie recommendation system built with **Streamlit**, which recommends top-rated movies based on a selected **genre**. The recommendations are generated by analyzing user ratings from a public dataset.

---

## 📌 Overview

This application allows users to:
- Select a movie **genre** from the sidebar.
- View the **top 5 movie recommendations** within that genre.
- Recommendations are based on the **average user ratings** from the dataset.

The system uses two input files:
- `movies.csv` — Contains movie metadata such as titles and genres.
- `ratings.csv` — Contains user-generated movie ratings.

## 💡 Recommendation Logic

1. Load and merge `movies.csv` with `ratings.csv` on `movieId`.
2. Extract all unique genres from the dataset.
3. When a user selects a genre:

   * Filter movies that belong to the selected genre.
   * Calculate the **average rating** and **rating count** for each movie.
   * Filter out movies with fewer than a minimum threshold of ratings (e.g., 10) to ensure quality.
   * Return the top 5 movies with the highest average rating.
